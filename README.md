Final project idea: 

Develop a 'dynamic' NFT which responds to Chainlink oracle data feeds

Notes:

I am interested in Chainlink's goal to get external world data on-chain in a reliable way.

Chainlink published a blog post about how external data feeds could enable 'dynamic' NFT's, which can respond to real world data, or other on chain data. https://blog.chain.link/create-dynamic-nfts-using-chainlink-oracles/

I have not seen any NFT project which has implemented this so far, so I'd like to try and build something along these lines.

For instance, an NFT which updates the image or properties of the NFT, depending on the weather forecast for the day, outcome of a sporting event, or something else.
